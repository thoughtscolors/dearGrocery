Grocery store list storage and product location mapping.

Moving to a new city and trying to find things in a new grocery store can be a huge time suck.
I have interviewed many potential users who hate spending time grocery shopping.

I aim to save people time at the grocery store by helping them enter their list beforehand in the app at home,
then when they get to the store they can map out where each item is specifically.

In the demo version search and product locations are very basic, but the idea is to not only have the aisle and shelf,
but also at what height the item is located at, for maximum efficiency.

When they grab the product from the shelf, they can then click to remove the item from their list,
and when the user's list is empty, it takes them to the shopping complete page.

Preferably, in an Amazon Go or Instacart implementation, this would automatically total all the items and allow
the user to checkout through the app.

Many more features, style, and functionality to add later. (And some minor bugs to work out)

Basic order of use:
1. Login
2. Add to list (Search)
3. Edit list (change quantity, remove item)
3. Populate map with item locations
4. Remove items from list as user moves through store
5. Complete shopping and checkout.
